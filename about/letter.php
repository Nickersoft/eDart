Yo.
My name is Tyler Nickerson.
Who am I?
GOD. 

Just kidding. 
I am a nineteen year old freshie at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA.
(wippie as Preston calls it).

Now for the burning question, why is there no CSS on this page?
Well, I figured that this site is going to be all about eDart, not me.
So I don't wanna draw too much attention away from the site I made.

Now, second burning question, why eDart?
Well, basically, I wanted to see what would happen if all monetary transaction was removed from society.
I mean, we don't all just have money to blow, do we?

Why buy new books every semester, or that new calculator you need, or that new binder, when
people have stood in the same shoes you're currently in? 
You can just borrow from them.

But, to keep it fair, you need to offer something in return.
But not everyone wants to just give up their stuff for someone
else's hand-me-downs. So that's why users can opt to have their stuff returned eventually. 

And that's how the concept of loan-based trading was invented
(true story, kids!)

Or not.
If you want to give away your stuff, you can.
That's an option too.

All up to you, kid.

PS: Quick shoutout to Preston Mueller for helping with some of the server config, and WideImage and JCrop for their ever-so-userful PHP and JS libraries for me to use. That is all.
