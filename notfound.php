				Don't you just hate that? You're browsing along, just minding your own business, then BAM! Page not found.
			</p>

				<b>How could you have screwed up?!</b> You were <i>sure</i> this link would work! Your friends, family... they all said "Press the link.", "Don't sweat it.", "It'll load.", "Can I use the computer now? You've been on for three hours." <b>How did you go wrong?!?</b> 
			</p>

			<p>
				Well, just move your way on over to that back button little fella, because even if you have 404 problems, don't have a broken link be one.
